## Integrating Authflow into Your Custom GPT

This is the most important section! Here's the complete step-by-step process to integrate your Authflow paywall into your custom GPT on ChatGPT.

> **💡 Pro Tip**: As one of the Authflow creators said: *"If you can copy and paste, you can implement a paywall."* It's really that simple!

### Prerequisites

Before starting the integration, make sure you have:
- ✅ Created a paywall in Authflow (see section above)
- ✅ A custom GPT created in ChatGPT
- ✅ Access to edit your custom GPT's configuration

### Step 1: Access Your Paywall Integration Details

1. In your Authflow dashboard, go to **"My Paywalls"** (under PAYWALLS in the sidebar)
2. You'll see a table listing all your paywalls
3. Find your paywall and click the **"Go"** button in the "Manage" column
4. This opens the paywall details page where you'll find all integration information

![Paywall Integration Details](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/facesift.firebasestorage.app/o/user_uploads%2F83EXwNWgaKe1BHmyd9ISw3HCEfi2%2F1765256222585-Screenshot%202025-12-08%20235655.png?alt=media&token=2e301877-996a-4609-8ce8-7e0d82ca22cf)

*The paywall details page shows all the integration information you need: GPT Schema, API Header Key, API Header Name, Privacy Policy, and Top Context Instructions.*

### Step 2: Copy the Schema

On the paywall details page, you'll see:

1. **GPT Schema**: This is the OpenAPI schema code you need to copy
   - Look for the section labeled "GPT Schema" 
   - Click the **"Copy"** button next to it
   - This contains all the API endpoint definitions

> **Note**: You don't need to format this - just copy it as-is. If there are any errors, they'll show up in red when you paste it into ChatGPT.

### Step 3: Copy the Authentication Credentials

You'll also need to copy:

1. **API Header Key**: 
   - This is your unique authentication token
   - Look for the field labeled "API Header Key"
   - Click **"Copy"** to copy it

2. **API Header Name**:
   - This is the header name for the API key (usually `x-api-key` or similar)
   - Look for the field labeled "API Header Name"
   - Click **"Copy"** to copy it

> **Important**: Keep your API key secret and never share it publicly!

### Step 4: Open Your Custom GPT in ChatGPT

1. Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) and navigate to your custom GPT
2. Click on your GPT to edit it
3. Make sure you're in the **"Configure"** tab

### Step 5: Create a New Action for the Paywall

> **⚠️ Important**: If you already have actions in your GPT (like RapidAPI integrations), **DO NOT edit those existing actions**. The paywall needs to be its own separate action.

1. Scroll down to the **"Actions"** section in your GPT configuration
2. Click **"Create new action"** or the **"+"** button
3. You can have multiple actions in one GPT - the paywall will be its own action

### Step 6: Paste the Schema

1. In the action configuration, find the schema/OpenAPI field (it's a large text box)
2. **Paste** the schema you copied from Authflow (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V, or right-click and paste)
3. You don't need to format it - just paste it directly
4. Optional: You can click **"Format"** if you want, but it's not required
5. If there are any errors, they'll appear in **red** - if you see no errors, you're good!
6. You should see an available action called **"check active paywall"** appear

> **💡 Tip**: The schema contains all the API endpoint definitions. Once pasted, ChatGPT will understand what Authflow actions are available.

### Step 7: Configure Authentication

This is where you connect your API key. **This step is required for the paywall to work:**

1. In the action configuration, scroll to the **"Authentication"** section
2. Click on **"API Key"** (the authentication type)
3. Select **"Custom"** (not "Bearer" or "Basic")
4. **Paste your API Header Key** in the API Key field (the one you copied from Authflow)
5. For the **"Custom Header Name"** field, paste the **API Header Name** you copied (usually `x-api-key`)
6. Click **"Save"**

> **That's it for the schema and authentication setup!** The action is now configured.

### Step 8: Add Privacy Policy

**Important**: You need to add the privacy policy for the action to work properly:

1. On the Authflow paywall details page, find the **"Privacy Policy"** section
2. **Copy** the privacy policy (click the **"Copy"** button)
3. Go back to your GPT action configuration
4. Find the **"Privacy Policy"** field in the action settings
5. **Paste** the privacy policy there
6. This is Authflow's universal privacy policy that explains the paywall integration to users

> **Note**: This privacy policy is specific to the Authflow action. If you have other actions in your GPT, you may want your own privacy policy for those, but for the Authflow action, use Authflow's privacy policy.

### Step 9: Add the Top Context Instructions (CRITICAL!)

This is the **most important step** - without this, your paywall won't work:

1. On the Authflow paywall details page, find **"Top Context Instructions"**
2. **Copy** these instructions (click the **"Copy"** button)
3. Go back to your GPT configuration
4. Scroll to the **"Instructions"** field (the main system prompt at the top of the Configure tab)
5. **Paste these instructions at the VERY TOP** of your instructions field
6. You can press Enter a couple times to separate them from your other instructions, but they **must be at the top**

> **Why this is critical**: These instructions tell your GPT how to call the Authflow API endpoints. They're what make the GPT check for subscriptions, verify emails, and prompt users to sign up. Without them at the top, the paywall functionality won't activate.

**What happens after adding instructions:**
- Your GPT will automatically ask users to verify their subscription
- It will prompt users to provide their email address
- It will call the Authflow API to check if the email has an active subscription
- If verified, users get access; if not, they're directed to sign up

### Step 10: Save and Test

1. **Save** all your GPT configuration changes
2. **Close** the action configuration if it's still open
3. **Test the integration**:
   - Start a **new conversation** with your GPT (important: start fresh!)
   - Try to use the GPT normally
   - You should see a message like: *"Before we continue, please verify your subscription with Authflow by providing your email address. You can register for your access here [link]. Once verified, I'll be happy to assist you."*

**Testing the Verification Flow:**

1. **Test with wrong email**: Try providing an email that doesn't have a subscription
   - The GPT should call the API and respond: *"There was an issue verifying your subscription. Please ensure you have an active subscription by visiting [link]."*

2. **Test with correct email**: Provide the email you used to sign up
   - The GPT should verify and say: *"Thank you for verifying your subscription! How can I assist you today?"*
   - Now you have full access to the GPT

3. **Test the payment link**: Click the registration link provided by the GPT
   - It should take you to the Authflow paywall page
   - You should see your paywall name, pricing, and free trial (if enabled)
   - Complete a test signup to verify the full flow

### Step 11: Customize the Paywall Message (Optional)

You can customize how the GPT asks for verification:

1. In your GPT instructions (below the Authflow instructions), add something like:
   ```
   When asking users to verify their subscription, refer to it as "[Your GPT Name] subscription" instead of "Authflow subscription"
   ```
2. This makes the message more branded to your GPT

### Step 12: Publish Your GPT

1. Once testing is complete, click **"Save"** in your GPT configuration
2. Click **"Share"** to get your GPT link
3. You can:
   - **Publish to Store**: Make it available in the ChatGPT Store
   - **Share the Link**: Send your GPT link to people directly
   - **Market It**: Share on social media, in groups, email lists, etc.

4. Your GPT is now monetized! 🎉

**What happens when users access your GPT:**
- They'll be prompted to verify their subscription
- If they don't have one, they'll be directed to sign up
- Once they subscribe and verify with their email, they get full access
- You'll receive payments directly to your Stripe account

---

## What Happens After Integration

Once you've completed the integration, here's what users will experience:

### User Experience Flow

1. **User Opens Your GPT**: They start a conversation with your GPT
2. **Verification Prompt**: Instead of getting help immediately, they see:
   > *"Before we continue, please verify your subscription with [Your GPT Name] by providing your email address. You can register for your access [here]. Once verified, I'll be happy to assist you."*

3. **User Provides Email**: They type their email address
4. **API Check**: Your GPT calls the Authflow API to verify if that email has an active subscription
5. **Two Possible Outcomes**:
   - **✅ Verified**: *"Thank you for verifying your subscription! How can I assist you today?"* → User gets full access
   - **❌ Not Verified**: *"There was an issue verifying your subscription. Please ensure you have an active subscription by visiting [link]."* → User is prompted to sign up

6. **Sign Up Flow**: If not verified, user clicks the link and:
   - Sees your paywall page with pricing
   - Can start a free trial (if enabled)
   - Enters payment information via Stripe
   - Receives email confirmation
   - Returns to GPT and verifies with their email
   - Gets full access

### Time to Set Up

- **Total Time**: Approximately **10-15 minutes** from start to finish
- **You can start making money the same day!**
- No coding required - just copy and paste

### Making Money

- **Passive Income**: Once set up, the system handles everything automatically
- **Recurring Revenue**: Monthly subscriptions provide ongoing income
- **Direct Payouts**: Money goes directly to your Stripe account
- **No Manual Work**: Users sign up, pay, and get access automatically

---

## Important Integration Notes

### Using One Paywall Across Multiple GPTs

**Yes, you can!** One paywall can be used across multiple GPTs:

- Copy the same schema into multiple GPTs
- All GPTs will share the same subscription/payment
- Users authenticate once and can access all GPTs using that paywall
- This is perfect if you have a bundle of related GPTs

### Creating Different Paywalls for Different GPTs

If you want different pricing for different GPTs:

- Create a separate paywall for each GPT
- Each paywall will have its own schema
- Users can subscribe to different GPTs at different price points

### Multiple Paywalls in One GPT

Currently, **you can only have one Authflow action per GPT**. If you need multiple pricing tiers (e.g., monthly and lifetime), you would need to:

- Create separate GPTs for each pricing tier, OR
- Wait for Authflow to add this feature (they're working on it!)

### Saving Space in Instructions

The Authflow instructions take up space in your GPT's 8,000 character limit. Here are some tips:

- The schema itself contains a lot of information, so you might not need as many custom instructions
- Some users have found that with detailed schemas, you can reduce the amount of custom instructions needed
- Authflow is working on a future version where instructions might not be needed at all - the schema will handle everything

### The Paywall Link

When you create a paywall, you'll also see a **"Paywall Link"**. You don't need this for GPT integration, but you can use it to:

- Share payment links directly (users don't need to go through the GPT)
- Use in marketing materials
- Send to people who want to subscribe without using the GPT first
- Use for any other purpose you can think of!

---

### Step 11: Monitor Your Paywall Performance

After your GPT is live, you can monitor its performance in the Authflow dashboard:

1. **Dashboard Overview**: 
   - Go to **"Dashboard"** in the sidebar to see an overview of all your paywalls
   - View metrics like total revenue, active subscriptions, and recent payments

2. **Analytics**:
   - Click **"Analytics"** to see detailed reports
   - Track revenue trends, user growth, and conversion rates
   - Filter by date ranges to analyze performance over time

3. **My Paywalls**:
   - View all your paywalls in one place
   - See statistics for each paywall including:
     - Total payout (revenue)
     - Number of payments
     - Unique authentications
     - Paid users
   - Download authentication reports for detailed analysis

4. **Customer Management**:
   - View all your customers and their subscription status
   - Manage subscriptions, handle cancellations, and view payment history

---

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

### Paywall Not Appearing

- **Check Instructions Placement**: Make sure the Authflow instructions are at the **very top** of your GPT instructions field
- **Verify Schema**: Check that the schema was pasted correctly with no errors (errors show in red)
- **Check Action Status**: Ensure the action is enabled and saved in your GPT configuration
- **Verify API Key**: Make sure your API key is correctly pasted in the authentication section

### Authentication Not Working

- **Verify Header Name**: Confirm you're using the exact header name from Authflow (usually `x-api-key`)
- **Check API Key Format**: Ensure there are no extra spaces before or after the API key when pasting
- **Authentication Type**: Make sure you selected **"Custom"** not "Bearer" or "Basic"
- **Test the Action**: Try using the "check active paywall" action in a conversation to see if it works

### Schema Errors Showing in Red

- **Check Formatting**: While you don't need to format the schema, make sure you copied the entire thing
- **No Partial Copies**: Ensure you copied the complete schema from Authflow
- **Refresh and Retry**: Sometimes refreshing the page and pasting again resolves formatting issues

### Instructions Character Limit (8,000 characters)

If you're hitting the 8,000 character limit for GPT instructions:

- **Place Authflow Instructions First**: Put the Authflow instructions at the top - they're required
- **Optimize Your Instructions**: Review your custom instructions and remove unnecessary text
- **Use Knowledge Base**: Consider putting some instructions in a knowledge base and referencing them
- **Schema Contains Info**: Remember that detailed schemas can reduce the need for extensive instructions
- **Future Solution**: Authflow is working on making instructions optional - the schema will handle everything

### Multiple Paywalls in One GPT

Currently, **you can only have one Authflow action per GPT**. If you need multiple pricing options:

- **Workaround**: Create separate GPTs for different pricing tiers (e.g., "GPT Name - Monthly" and "GPT Name - Lifetime")
- **Future Feature**: Authflow is working on supporting multiple paywalls in one GPT
- **Alternative**: Use one paywall and offer different features/access levels within the same subscription

### Payment Flow Issues
